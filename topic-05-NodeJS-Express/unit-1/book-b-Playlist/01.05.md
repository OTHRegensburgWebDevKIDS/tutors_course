# Detailansicht der Playlisten – Router bisher 

Aktuelle Version:

~~~ js
    const express = require("express"); 
    const router = express.Router(); 
     
    const home = require("./controllers/home.js"); 
    const about = require("./controllers/about.js"); 
    const dashboard = require("./controllers/dashboard.js"); 
     
    router.get("/", home.index); 
    router.get("/about", about.index); 
    router.get("/dashboard", dashboard.index); 
     
    module.exports = router; 
~~~

Unterstützde Routen: 

~~~js 
router.get("/", home.index); 
router.get("/about", about.index); 
router.get("/dashboard", dashboard.index); 
~~~
We now have a new pattern /playlist/id, which we would like to route to a controller that would render a new view detailing the playlist contents. Also note that each of these statements matches a route pattern with a function inside a controller.

So, for instance, this import + route: 

~~~js
router.get("/about", about.index); 
~~~

… ensures that this function would be called if the route was triggered: 

~~~js 
const logger = require("../utils/logger.js"); 
 
const about = { 
  index(request, response) { 
    logger.info("about rendering"); 
    const viewData = { 
      title: "About Playlist 1" 
    }; 
    response.render("about", viewData); 
  } 
}; 
 
module.exports = about; 
~~~
