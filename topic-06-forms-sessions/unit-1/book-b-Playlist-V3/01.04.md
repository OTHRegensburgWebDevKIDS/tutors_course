## Self Study

If you want to download a complete version of the app as it should be at the end of this lab, then create a new Glitch project, and clone this repo:

You can also clone this repo directly, run 'npm install' from inside the folder and then run from within Webstorm.

### Exercise 1: Display Durations
Make sure the duration of each song and playlist is visible on the UX

### Exercise 2: Add Song Duration
Modify the add song form to accept a song duration as well as title and artist:

Make sure the duration is stored in the data store, and is displayed on the playlist view.

HINT: When reading a parameter from a form representing a `number`, you will need to convert it from string. The Number function is one simple way of doing this:

~~~ js 
    const newSong = {
      id: uuid(),
      title: request.body.title,
      artist: request.body.artist,
      duration: Number(request.body.duration),
    };
